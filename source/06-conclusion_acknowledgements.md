# Conclusion {#sec:conclusion}

This study has looked at what is most-likely the first wave of disruptions from
new mobility businesses in Toronto. Trip growth is not anticipated to slow in
the upcoming years and these services will likely create traffic and
operational challenges throughout the City in the future. However, the rapid
growth in trips demonstrates ridesourcing services have been immensely popular
with Toronto residents. They now play an important role in many residents'
daily travel patterns including an increasing role in daily commuter travel.

An executive summary of the Transportation Impacts of Vehicle-for-Hire report was
attached to the Staff Report prepared by Municipal Licensing & Standards and
presented to the General Governance & Licensing committee on June 24, 2019.
Councillors requested we report on the number of ride-sourcing vehicles
operating and to elaborate on our findings regarding congestion. The report and
these additional analyses were discussed at City Council on July 18th.
Council approved staff recommendations, with amendments. The following relevant
regulations were approved:

- Request that taxi/ridesourcing be a field on the standardized collision
  reporting form. Require that all vehicle for hire brokerages and companies
  report collision incidents.
- Create an accessibility fund to encourage the purchases of accessible
  vehicles.
- Require that all vehicle for hire drivers receive driver training.
- Require additional data to be provide by ridesourcing companies: aggregate
  vehicle volumes in geographic areas, pick-up and drop-off data at a
  $10\,\mathrm{m}$ resolution, aggregate number of vehicles having completed
  trips by hour.
- Require that taxi brokerages provide similar trip record data as ridesourcing
  companies

Council further required Transportation Services to report in 2020 on whether
there has been an impact on congestion from vehicles for hire, what mitigating
measures can be taken, and determine the appropriate number of vehicles for
hire. Council also required a report on the safety of ridesourcing operations
and the feasibility of requiring vehicle for hire applications to route them
such that they do not stop to pick-up or drop-off passengers in "no stopping"
zones. 

The goal of the Transportation Impact Study was to build a deeper understanding
of these new services and to pave the way for future work and studies to keep
in front of these rapidly changing trends. This will allow the City to define
policy to support the benefits of ridesourcing services while minimizing
adverse impacts to traffic, to the environment and to the equity of mobility
services.

Having performed this comprehensive study, we claim that transportation
agencies need three important datasets to be derived from ridesourcing
activity, each which its own utility for regulation:

- **Trip OD records:** for transportation planning;
- **Ridesourcing vehicle volumes:** for congestion management; and
- **Pick-up/drop-off activity:** for curbside management and vision zero
  planning.

For the purposes of this study we were provided trip records and PUDO data, and
we presented a novel process to derive vehicle volumes from trip records which
other agencies could use.
