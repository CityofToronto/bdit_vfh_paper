This section highlights the key results from our analyses, focussing on
congestion and curbside activity.

Ridesourcing trips have grown rapidly since September 2016, when the service
was first licensed by the City. An average of 176,000 trips were made daily in
March 2019, an increase of over 180% since September 2016. As of March 2019,
105 million ridesourcing trips have been completed in the City of Toronto.

Ridesourcing trip-making peaks are observed in two distinct time periods:

- **Friday and Saturday Nights:** the busiest periods are Friday and Saturday
  nights, peaking at an average 13,100 trips per hour at midnight on Sunday
  morning. This time period is typically associated with nightlife activity,
  which is reflected in the dominance of trips in the downtown Entertainment
  District during this time.
- **Weekday Commuting Periods:** ridesourcing is heavily used in the morning
  and afternoon peak periods, typically associated with the times during which
  the road network experiences the most traffic. This trip market has increased
  over the past two years.

## Ridesourcing trips are more commuter-focused outside of Downtown

Commuter trips are emerging as a major trip market that are being increasingly
captured by ridesourcing. This is illustrated in Figure [-@fig:commtow],
which shows a landscape with two distinct geographies: downtown neighbourhoods
generally see more than two Friday and Saturday night trips (7 p.m. to 3 a.m.)
for every weekday commuter period (weekdays 7 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. to 7
p.m.) trip while the opposite is true in the suburbs where trips are much more
commuter-focused. Figure [-@fig:commtow] also compares the average hourly
pick-ups by hour of week for September for the downtown district of Toronto and
East York, and the three suburban districts combined. Trip rates are similar
between the two geographies weekdays from 4 a.m. until 8 a.m., when they peak
in the suburbs. Approximately half of these trips are to the nearest subway
station (10%) or within their district (40%), the other half are to other
suburban districts (40%) or to downtown (10%). This demonstrates that a portion
of ridesourcing service is helping bring passengers to subway service while
alleviating concerns that they are enabling significant volumes of commuters to
be driven downtown during the peak.

For trips starting downtown, the a.m. peak occurs an hour later at nearly 5,000
trips/hr. This is also an hour later than peak transit ridership according to
the Transportation Tomorrow Survey \cite{wenting2019transitcharacteristics}.
This is when ride-sourcing is least competitive with transit, with travel time
savings of on average 8 min/trip. 73% of these trips would have been one-seat
rides had they been taken \cite{wenting2019transitcharacteristics}.

The suburban afternoon peak is as high as the morning peak if a little wider.
Downtown the afternoon peak continues into the evening, bolstered by evening
entertainment trips.

## Ridesourcing in Downtown Toronto make up 5-8% of total traffic

Figure [-@fig:volfraction] shows our conservative estimate of ridesourcing
volumes which does not include cruising estimates. The largest volumes of
ridesourcing vehicles are concentrated downtown where they account for
between 5 and 8% of overall daily traffic in downtown neighbourhoods. The
busiest neighbourhood is Waterfront Communities-The Island, which includes major
transportation nodes such as Union Station and Billy Bishop Airport.

On this day, ridesourcing accounted for approximately 1,230,000 VKT. This is
estimated to be 1.9% of the total 67,200,000 VKT traveled in Toronto on average.
The proportion of traffic in a.m. and p.m. peak commuting periods is slightly
lower than the overall daily totals, reflecting the higher relative ridesourcing
volumes that occur during evening hours.

## Downtown travel times have been stable over 18 months while ridesourcing trips increased by 96% 

Figure [-@fig:bt_traveltime] shows the percent change in average travel time
based on Bluetooth sensor readings on most major streets in the downtown core,
the area of the City where ridesourcing trip concentrations are highest. This
data shows marginal changes in travel times over the 18 months from October
2017 to March 2019 in the downtown core. Travel times on major streets have
increased by 4% in the morning peak hour (7 to 10 a.m.), and decreased by 1% in
both the afternoon peak period (4 to 7 p.m.) and Friday and Saturday nights (10
p.m. to 1 a.m.). Over this same span, ridesourcing trips increased 96%
city-wide, from 83,800 to 164,000 daily trips.<!--  These findings are consistent
with the recently-completed evaluation of the impacts of the King Street
Transit Pilot \cite{kingstreetpilot} which showed no significant changes in travel times on downtown
streets over the Pilot period. -->

Given that changes in travel times have been negligible in the neighbourhoods
where ridesourcing makes up the largest proportions of overall traffic, there
is insufficient evidence at this time to make any definitive linkages between
ridesourcing volumes and changes in travel time.

## Pick-up and drop-off data highlight conflicts with no-stopping zones and bike lanes 

![Hourly average number of ridesourcing pick-ups and drop-offs adjacent to bike

\label{fig:bikeconflict}](source/figures/trb_bikeconflict.pdf){width=100%}

A particular safety concern with ridesourcing pick-up and drop-off activity is
potential conflicts with cyclists, especially when it occurs in close proximity
to cycling infrastructure. A detailed look at pick-up/drop-off data has shown hotspots during the morning
commute period where pick-up and drop-off activity is occurring in no-stopping
zones. The largest hotspots are in the Financial District. Figure
[-@fig:bikeconflict] shows a similar analysis of pick-ups and drop-offs
adjacent to bike lanes and separated bike facilities between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.
during a typical weekday in September 2018. There is a significant volume of
pick-up and drop-off activity near high-use bike facilities. This highlights
locations that could benefit from additional separation between bike lanes and
vehicular traffic. Despite the greater accuracy of the positions, it is
impossible to conclude from this data whether the ridesourcing vehicle was
within or adjacent to a bike lane while picking up or dropping off passengers.
Nevertheless, these hotspots indicate where they may be a high risk of
conflicts.

<!-- Common curbside ridesourcing manoeuvres that pose
safety risks for cyclists include vehicles moving into and stopping in the bike
lane, requiring a cyclist to manoeuvre around the blocked lane (compounded when
streetcar tracks are present); drivers and/or passengers opening car doors;
passengers attempting to cross the lane after exiting the vehicle; and drivers
encroaching onto or coming close to bike lanes while making U-turns to pick-up
or drop-off in a particular direction. -->
