# Abstract

We present a comprehensive study of how the introduction of ridesourcing
companies such as Uber and Lyft has changed travel patterns and behaviours in
the City of Toronto. Origin-destination data for nearly 100 million trips
between 2016 and 2019 were analyzed to determine spatial and temporal trends
for ridesourcing activity. These data were combined with car travel time,
public transportation network and city bylaw data to investigate the impact
of ridesourcing on the transportation network, public transit and cyclists.
To determine the fraction of total City vehicle kilometres travelled (VKT) due to
ridesourcing vehicles, we routed individual trips, and linked trip drop-off
points with nearby pick-up points to simulate driver deadheading between trips.
We find a three-fold growth in the total number of trips per day, with the
greatest absolute growth situated in downtown Toronto during Friday and
Saturday evenings. The greatest fractional growth, on the other hand, is in
weekday commuter trips in the suburbs. A conservative estimate of ridesourcing
vehicle volumes show they account for $\sim 5 - 8\%$ of overall daily VKT in
September 2018, roughly a factor of two increase from October 2016.  Over a
similar period we find only marginal changes in travel time on downtown Toronto
streets. We analyze curbside pick-up and drop-off data to demonstrate a need to
study further how to improve curbside operations to improve safety.
